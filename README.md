# DotNet.DependencyInjectionBenchmarks
Benchmarks for .net dependency injection containers

Note: These benchmarks are not meant to cover all Dependency Injection containers in existence. I am not looking for PR's to add more containers. Daniel Palme has an excelent benchmark suite that can be found [here](https://github.com/danielpalme/IocPerformance) that is intended to cover more containers.
