Published Results can be found [here](https://ipjohnson.github.io/DotNet.DependencyInjectionBenchmarks/)

Note: PR's are welcome but if you are adding a new container please stay within the spirit of the tests. That  Daniel Palme has an excelent benchmark suite that can be found [here](https://github.com/danielpalme/IocPerformance) that has far more containers.
